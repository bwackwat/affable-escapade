<h2>Software Portfolio</h2>
<p>My history as a software geek began with object-oriented fun with Java, and has progressed far since.</p>
<p>I have worked with C, C++, C#, (.NET, ) Java, Scala, Python, JavaScript, Unix Shell, PowerShell, *web languages*, LC-3, and CL.</p>

<h2>2006 - 2010</h2>
<p>
High school was a time to play video games, and to deepen my understanding of how they worked on the inside. I made sample Java applications, some of which inspired me and still work. I investigated and used Java Swing, data structures, algorithms, file I/O, and some socket and servlet programming. As a sophomore, a group of classmates and I from a Computer Science course won the 2008 <a href="/media/teamdefendvictory.JPG">NDIA STEM TeamDefend Competition</a>! It was fun and I learned some odd things about supercomputers hacking slightly-vulnerable Windows Server 2003 services.

<h2>2004 - 2006</h2>
<p>
Fondly I remember the C++ programming language and learning about it with a friend. I learned about polymorphism, variables, methods, language syntax, APIs, and other cryptic fundamentals such as stdin/stdout and cin/cout. We worked together on a rudimentary project in which users enjoyed a tree of "paths" (text RPG) and responded to queries, all in the console.

<h2>1992 - 2004</h2>
<p>
I quickly grew into enjoying Windows 95/98 video games such as Mech Warrior, Uprising, and Lemmings. I remember playing old Macintosh Apple games and other ancient games on Windows 3.0. Windows XP came out into excellent releases such as Starcraft, Warcraft III (TFT), Unreal Tournament 2004, Half-Life 2, and Doom 3. In the back of my mind the whole time I wondered how these worlds and scenes were rendering. I thought about the filesystem, the internet, and the operating systems underlying.
